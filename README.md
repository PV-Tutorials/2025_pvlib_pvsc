![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PV-Tutorials/2025_pvlib_pvsc/refs/heads/main/static/pvlib_pvsc_logo.png)

The tutorial will be an introduction to how to model bifacial tracking systems using the open-source pvlib Python package. This repository contains the content used for the tutorial.

## Practical information
You do not need to have prior programming experience or Python installed (we'll be using the Google Colab online programming environment).
